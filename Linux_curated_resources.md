# Linux CLI and Shell scripting

Collection of resources for Linux command line, shell scripting (mostly `bash`) and a few on topics like Linux Kernel, distributions, applications, etc.

## Installation and Documentation

>A Linux distribution (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution) — [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)
